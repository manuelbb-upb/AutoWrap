# AutoWrap.jl
## Automatic Specialization of Functions 

This package allows for defining very specialized methods of a function based on 
a *type mapping*. 
Its goal is similar to that of [Hyperspecialize.jl](https://github.com/willow-ahrens/Hyperspecialize.jl)
and for now we refer to the README of Hyperspecialize for an in-depth motivation.

## Examples

ToDo... look into "test" folder, maybe.
